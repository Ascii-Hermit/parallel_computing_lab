1. Processor (CPU)

    A processor (also referred to as a CPU or Central Processing Unit) is the **main computing unit** of a computer. Itâ€™s responsible for executing instructions from programs, performing calculations, and controlling the operation of other components.
    A processor may consist of **one or more cores**. For example, a dual-core processor has two cores, while a quad-core processor has four cores.

2. Core

    A core is an individual processing unit **within a processor** (also known as a CPU). Each core can execute instructions independently of others.
    Modern CPUs often have multiple cores that allow them to perform parallel processing, meaning each core can handle different tasks simultaneously.
    For example, a quad-core processor has four cores
    Example: An Intel Core i7 processor is an example of a multi-core processor that contains multiple cores to enhance performance.

3. Thread

    A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, which allows it to perform multiple tasks concurrently. A thread is a **sequence of instructions that the CPU can execute independently**.
    Example: A dual-core processor can typically handle 2 threads simultaneously.

4. Multicore

    Multicore refers to a processor that has more than one core. A multicore processor is capable of executing multiple threads or tasks simultaneously, improving multitasking and parallel processing capabilities.
    Each core in a multicore processor can independently execute instructions.

5. Multiprocessor

    A multiprocessor system refers to a computer system that has multiple processors (CPUs), each potentially with its own set of cores. In a multiprocessor setup, each processor can operate independently or collaboratively to perform tasks.
    Multiprocessor systems are typically used in high-performance computing environments.
